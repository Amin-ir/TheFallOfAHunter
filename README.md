# The Fall Of A Hunter
My first experience on Android 2D Game development.

## Overview
A simple RPG game, with a tragedy story about a mercenary who is hired by both demons and humans, once he gets hired by a strange client.
The game consists free running, simple fight mechanisms e.g. dodging, heave/light/chained attacks and a boss fight; Player may upgrade the character alongside his journey using xp points and save his progress.
The character has 3 styles for fighting, each including a unique attack which is available after filling the stamina bar.
Players can review the provided mechnisms and tips through the codex menu.
